# TEAnnotator
## Purpose
A pipeline to provide annotations of transposable element (TE) content in a genome, combining the inputs from a variety of annotators (e.g. RepeatMasker, RepeatModeler) into one non-redundant fasta file.
## Requirements
Written in python3.

Requires:

RepeatMasker v4.0.6 or later (and its dependencies)

RepeatModeler v1.0.8 or later (and its dependencies)
# Usage
Basic usage is:
```bash
python3 TEAnnotator.py -i input.fas
```
TEAnnotator accepts the following arguments (all of which have defaults already set):
-i (input fasta file)
-c (number of cores)
-s (taxon model to use for RepeatMasker)
-u (cutoff value for RepeatMasker)
-m (minimum length of repeat annotation)
--lowcomplex (include low complexity repeats, which are screened out by default)
