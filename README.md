# TEAnnotator
## Purpose
A pipeline to provide annotations of transposable element (TE) content in a genome, combining the inputs from a variety of annotators (e.g. RepeatMasker, RepeatModeler) into one non-redundant fasta file.
## Requirements
Written in python3.

Requires:

RepeatMasker v4.0.6 or later (and its dependencies)

RepeatModeler v1.0.8 or later (and its dependencies)
